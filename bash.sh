5. Summarized Command Sequence
Replace <namespace> and <pod> as needed:

sh
Copy
Edit
# List service accounts and see imagePullSecrets
oc get serviceaccount -n <namespace> -o yaml

# Check which SA your pod uses
oc get pod <pod> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.serviceAccountName}'

# List secrets attached to that SA (for image pulls)
oc get serviceaccount <serviceaccount> -n <namespace> -o yaml

# Inspect the actual secret
oc get secret <secret-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
What is Expected?
If no imagePullSecrets are set: OCP will use credentials available to the node (such as registry service accounts, or global pull secrets, depending on cluster setup).

If imagePullSecrets are set: Only those credentials are used for that pod‚Äôs image pull.

In short:
The pod uses the image pull secret specified either directly in its spec or via its service account. By tracing these references, you can determine which registry credentials are in use.

If you want to check cluster-wide pull secrets (applies to all namespaces, for internal registries):

sh
Copy
Edit
oc get secret pull-secret -n openshift-config -o yaml
Let me know if you want a script or a more automated way to check this for all pods in a namespace!

how do i see the content of the cluster pull-secret


ChatGPT said:
To see the contents of the OpenShift cluster-wide pull-secret, which is typically stored in the openshift-config namespace and used for global image pulls (e.g., from registry.redhat.io), follow these steps:

üîç 1. Get the pull-secret
sh
Copy
Edit
oc get secret pull-secret -n openshift-config -o jsonpath='{.data.\.dockerconfigjson}' | base64 -d | jq
