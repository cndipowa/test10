🧠 OVERVIEW: WHY OTEL + ISTIO?
Istio is a service mesh that transparently manages traffic between microservices. OpenTelemetry (OTEL) is a vendor-neutral standard for collecting telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs). Combining the two gives you:

Automated distributed tracing of service-to-service calls.

Insightful metrics to optimize system behavior.

Easier debugging via tracing tools like Jaeger.

Topology visibility via Kiali.

⚙️ COMPONENTS AND ARCHITECTURE
🔷 1. Istio
Provides automatic instrumentation for HTTP/GRPC via sidecars (Envoy proxies).

Sends telemetry data via Envoy filters.

Collects metrics, traces, logs with no code changes to your app.

🔷 2. OpenTelemetry Collector
Ingests trace data from Envoy.

Transforms, enriches, and exports to backend (e.g. Jaeger).

Acts as gateway between Istio and observability backends.

🔷 3. Jaeger
Distributed tracing UI.

Visualizes traces collected from Istio via OTEL.

🔷 4. Kiali
Istio’s observability UI.

Shows service graph, traffic flow, trace summaries (via Jaeger integration).

🔷 5. Prometheus + Grafana (optional)
For metrics and dashboards.

Istio emits metrics to Prometheus by default.
