üéØ Goal:
Show how Istio with OpenTelemetry enables distributed tracing, metrics collection, and logging across microservices ‚Äî critical for debugging, monitoring, and observability.

üß± Core Components & Interaction
1. Istio Proxy (Envoy)
Automatically injected into pods (sidecar).

Captures metrics, traces, and logs from service-to-service traffic.

Exports these as telemetry data.

2. OpenTelemetry Collector
Gathers telemetry from Istio sidecars.

Processes and forwards it to a backend like Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, or Elastic.

3. Telemetry Backends
Jaeger: For tracing (track requests across services).

Prometheus/Grafana: For metrics.

Loki/Elastic: For logs.

4. Instrumented Apps (optional)
You can also manually instrument apps with OTEL SDKs to add spans or custom metrics.

üîÅ How They Interact

Edit
Service A --->
         [Envoy Sidecar] ---> OpenTelemetry Collector ---> Jaeger (Traces)
Service B --->
The Envoy proxy in each pod sends trace data via OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) to the OTEL Collector. The Collector can batch, filter, or transform data before forwarding it to Jaeger or other backends.
