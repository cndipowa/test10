Istio is a mature, open-source service mesh that gives federal agencies full control over how services communicate—securely, reliably, and observably. It offloads complex networking concerns like service discovery, encryption, retries, timeouts, and access control from your apps and centralizes them in the mesh, so your teams can develop faster, deploy safer, and meet compliance requirements more easily. With Istio, you gain built-in zero-trust security, policy enforcement, and deep traffic insights—all without modifying your application code.
