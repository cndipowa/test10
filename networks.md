🧭 1. Purpose of the Diagram
Planning: New architecture, expansion, or migration.

Troubleshooting: Highlighting failure domains and dependencies.

Documentation: Audits, compliance, onboarding.

Security Review: Visibility into traffic flow and boundary protection.

🧩 2. Level of Detail
High-level (logical): Applications, services, zones (e.g., frontend ↔ backend ↔ DB).

Low-level (physical or infrastructure): IPs, ports, firewalls, switches, pods, etc.

Hybrid: Logical overlays on physical infrastructure.

🖧 3. Components to Include
Depending on the level, include some or all of:

Nodes: Servers, VMs, pods, endpoints, edge devices

Network Devices: Routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers

Services: DNS, DHCP, proxy, identity providers

Connections: Protocols, ports, bandwidth, routes

Zones/Subnets: DMZ, internal LAN, VPN, cloud VPCs

Cloud Components: VPC, subnets, gateways, security groups

Service Mesh (if applicable): Ingress, egress, sidecars, control plane

🛡️ 4. Security Context
Trust boundaries (zones where security policies change)

Encryption zones (e.g., TLS termination points)

External vs internal exposure

Authentication & authorization flows (e.g., OIDC, mTLS)

🛠️ 5. Tools and Standards
Tools: draw.io, Lucidchart, Visio, Diagrams.net, Mermaid.js, Cloudcraft, or automated with tools like Weave Scope, Istio Viz, NetBox, Backstage, etc.

Symbols/Standards: Use standard icons for AWS, Azure, Cisco, Kubernetes, etc.

Layering: Consider layering by OSI model (Layer 3, Layer 7), or zones (dev, staging, prod).

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 6. Audience
Engineers: Want details on IPs, CIDRs, interfaces.

Security Teams: Focus on trust zones, vulnerabilities.

Executives/PMs: Prefer high-level service flow with dependencies.

Adapt granularity and terminology to fit.

📈 7. Dynamic vs Static
Decide if you want a static drawing or an automatically updated view (e.g., from Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, or Istio telemetry).

🗃️ 8. Metadata and Labels
Label everything:

IP address

Hostname or service name

Environment (dev/test/prod)

Namespace (in Kubernetes)

Owner or responsible team

Example Sections in a Well-Organized Diagram:
